### Points to remember
✔ An orphan record means it is a record in child table but it doesn’t have association with its parent in the application.   
✔ If a child record is removed from the collection and if we want to remove that child record immediately from the database, 
then we need to set the cascade =”all-delete-orphan”.   
✔ SessionFactory is thread safe whereas Session is not thread safe.   
✔ SessionFactory and Session both are interfaces.
